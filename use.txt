This artifact has been created to reproduce the results presented in the paper “DP-Mix: Differentially Private Routing in Mix Networks”, accepted for publication at ACSAC 2025, and to provide an environment that makes the code usable for future research. You can execute the code on any standard laptop or workstation running Ubuntu 18.04 or higher. It is compatible with Python 3.8.10. Alternatively, the repository can be cloned and executed in a Google Colab environment.  

Importantly, the artifact includes precisely the same configurations and settings used in the original DP-Mix evaluation. The only exception is that the number of iterations and some minor parameters have been scaled down to ensure feasibility on standard hardware. These configuration parameters can be reviewed and, where appropriate, modified in the initialization of DP_Mix_Functions.py. This adjustment ensures that the artifact remains practical for local execution, while still supporting future extensions where researchers may wish to adapt our approach to scenarios not explicitly tested in DP-Mix.  

That said, modifying parameters requires a deeper understanding of mixnets. Mixnets are complex systems in which changes to a single parameter may influence others. In many cases, certain parameter combinations may be incompatible or may significantly affect the overall results. Additionally, several parameters are initialized based on prior work, and their default values were chosen to support meaningful comparisons. As such, arbitrary modifications may not yield valid outcomes.  

However, the following parameters in the initialization of DP_Mix_Functions can be safely modified within specific intervals:  

- self.Iterations: can be increased up to 30 to improve accuracy; note that this change increases computational cost exponentially.
  
- self.num_targets: specifies the number of target messages in the simulations; can be set to any integer in [20,200].  

- self.run: defines the duration of each simulation time slot; can be set to any real value in [0.05,1.0]. 
 
- self.delay1: represents the average delay imposed on each message upon entering mixnodes; can be set to any real value in [0.01,0.08]. 
 

Other parameters should not be modified, as they are tied to fixed design assumptions in mixnets. Altering them may lead to execution errors or invalid experimental results. If users wish to modify such parameters, we recommend contacting the authors directly for further guidance. 


 

Execution notes: If the following warnings appear during execution, they can be safely ignored:  

1) Gdk-CRITICAL **: 13:07:09.758: gdk_cursor_new_for_display: assertion 'GDK_IS_DISPLAY (display)' failed  

2) UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout, so results might be incorrect.
