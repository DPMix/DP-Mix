Claim 2: 
 
This claim concerns the trend shown in Figure 6. Across all settings and scenarios, when the variable on the x-axis (the privacy parameter \( \varepsilon \)) increases, the corresponding entropy decreases. This claim is supported by Experiment E2, which generated Figure 6 and demonstrates this trend.  





How to reproduce: 

You can reproduce this experiment in one of two ways:  

1. From the command line, run: bash ./Claims/Claim2/run_E_2.sh to execute the experiment directly.  

2. Alternatively, in Google Colab, open Main.py and run it once. When prompted for an input value, enter 6.  

After execution, the results will be saved as Fig_6a.png, Fig_6b.png, Fig_6c.png, and Fig_6d.png in the artifact/Figures/ directory.  





Verification:

You can compare the results with Figure 6 in the paper or with the pre-generated figures provided in Claims/Claim2/expected/. The latter is preferable since it was produced using the current artifact with a reduced number of iterations, yielding outputs more consistent with those obtained when running the artifact.  



Runtime:

This experiment requires less than 10 minutes to complete.
