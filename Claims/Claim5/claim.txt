Claim 5:

This claim concerns the trend shown in Figure 8. Across all settings and scenarios, when the variable on the x-axis (the adversary budget C/N) increases, the fraction of corrupted paths (FCP) shown on the y-axis increases. This claim is supported by Experiment E5, which generated Figure 9 and demonstrates this trend.



How to reproduce: 

To run the experiment supporting this claim, first change the directory to ./Claims/Claim5/. You can then reproduce this experiment in one of two ways:  

1. From the command line, run: bash ./run_E_5.sh  to execute the experiment directly.  

2. Alternatively, in Google Colab, run:  !bash ./run_E_5.sh  to execute the experiment.





Verification:

You can compare the results with Figure 9 in the paper or with the pre-generated figures provided in Claims/Claim5/expected/. The latter is preferable since it was produced using the current artifact with a reduced number of iterations, yielding outputs more consistent with those obtained when running the artifact.  



Runtime:

This experiment requires less than 10 minutes to complete.
