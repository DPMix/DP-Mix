## Claim 1: 
 
The first claim concerns the trend shown in **Figure 5**. Across all settings and scenarios, when the variable on the x-axis (the privacy parameter \( \varepsilon \)) increases, the corresponding latency decreases. This claim is supported by Experiment E1, which generated Figure 5 and demonstrates this trend.  





How to reproduce: 

To run the experiment supporting this claim, first change the directory to ./Claims/Claim1/. You can then reproduce this experiment in one of two ways:  

1. From the command line, run: bash ./run_E_1.sh  to execute the experiment directly.  

2. Alternatively, in Google Colab, run:  !bash ./run_E_1.sh  to execute the experiment.






Verification:

You can compare the results with Figure 5 in the paper or with the pre-generated figures provided in Claims/Claim1/expected/. The latter is preferable since it was produced using the current artifact with a reduced number of iterations, yielding outputs more consistent with those obtained when running the artifact.  



Runtime:

This experiment requires less than 10 minutes to complete.
