Claim 3: 
 
This claim concerns the trend shown in Figure 7. Across all settings and scenarios, when the variable on the x-axis (the privacy parameter \( \varepsilon \)) increases, 
the entropy of messages shown on the y-axis decreases. This claim is supported by Experiment E3, which generated Figure 7 and demonstrates this trend.




How to reproduce: 

To run the experiment supporting this claim, first change the directory to ./Claims/Claim3/. You can then reproduce this experiment in one of two ways:  

1. From the command line, run: bash ./run_E_3.sh  to execute the experiment directly.  

2. Alternatively, in Google Colab, run:  !bash ./run_E_3.sh  to execute the experiment.





Verification:

You can compare the results with Figure 7 in the paper or with the pre-generated figures provided in Claims/Claim3/expected/. 
The latter is preferable since it was produced using the current artifact with a reduced number of iterations, yielding outputs more consistent with those obtained when running the artifact.  



Runtime:

This experiment requires less than 20 minutes to complete.
